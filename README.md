# CulminatingProject
Repository for committing and pushing all code related to the final project. Please include detailed descriptions. 

The program represented in this repository is all built from scratch from people who have been assigned
to create a program for a school assessment. Everything is not necessarily original ideas and/or physics
compared to real copyrighted works from other people. We do not endorse any company and are just a group
of people who need to create a game while using parody ideas from such copyrighted actions/images/ideas.
